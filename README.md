react-apollo-koa-passport-example
========================

An example web app using React, Apollo (GraphQL), Koa v.2, and Passport.

This project was generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
and is not [eject](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject)ed.
Some settings are overwritten on runtime though.

Setup
=====

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Install required packages.

```sh
% yarn
```

Copy `.env.default` to `.env` and edit it to change server-side settings.

Copy `config-default.json` to `config.json` and edit it to change client-side
settings.

Copy `Caddyfile-dev` to `Caddyfile`.

The API server and the development web server launch on port 7000 and 3000
respectively. The development proxy server, running on port 8000 redirects
API requests to `localhost:7000`.

Usage
=====

Launch the proxy server:
```sh
% yarn caddy
```

Launch the API server:

```sh
% yarn run server
```

Launch the development web server which serves the static client-side files:

```sh
% yarn start
```

Open the URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser.

Frameworks/Libraries
====================

### Client-side

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and
  [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux)
  (URL routes management)
* [redux-auth-wrapper](https://github.com/mjrussell/redux-auth-wrapper) and
  [passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) (Authentication)
* [redux-logic](https://github.com/jeffbski/redux-logic)
  with [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
  (Async logic management)
* [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
  (Customizing create-react-app w/o ejection)
* [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/) (GraphQL)
* [Semantic-UI-React](http://react.semantic-ui.com/) (CSS framework)
* [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook) and
  [StoryShots](https://github.com/storybooks/storyshots) (UI dev and test)

The application code was generated by create-react-app.

See package.json for more information.

### Server-side (the API server)

* [Koa v.2](https://github.com/koajs/koa)
* [koa-passport](https://github.com/rkusa/koa-passport) (Authentication)
* [Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/) (GraphQL)
* [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) (Proxy)

See package.json for more information.

The API server does not use DB and stores data on memory.
All changes will be cleared when you stop the server.

The development build depends on Caddy for proxying to the Koa backend,
which is required for proper handling of OAuth2 based authentication.
(An external proxy server is currently necessary, as here is a bug in the
  webpack dev server proxy where anchor element links on the same domain are
  captured by React and render 404s.)

### Unit Tests

* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) (Shallow rendering)

### Integration Tests

* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (Test Runner)
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) (Assertio)
* [Nightmare](http://www.nightmarejs.org/) (Browser automation)

### Repo and code management

  [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
  and our custom rules (JavaScript lint)
* [Flow](https://flow.org/) and

GraphQL/Apollo
==============

Persisted Queries
-----------------

GraphQL querires, mutations and subscriptions are defined in `src/graphql` as `.graphql` files.
They can be used as persisted queries.

You can enable persisted queries by modifying `config.json`.

```json
{
    "persistedQueries": true
}
```

You need to generate `extracted_queries.json` by executing this.

```sh
% yarn run persistgraphql
```

Read the following article to know about persisted queries.

* [Persisted GraphQL Queries with Apollo Client](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/persisted-graphql-queries-with-apollo-client-119fd7e6bba5#.wnzn2qlpf)

Subscriptions
-------------

This example project uses subscriptions.
Select "GraphQL Subscription" tab in the header to see it.

It has not been integrated with authentication.

Read the following article to know about subscriptions.

* [A proposal for GraphQL subscriptions](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/a-proposal-for-graphql-subscriptions-1d89b1934c18#.vso7t15e5)

Authentication
--------------

The Apollo subscription in this app is not integrated with the authentication yet.
See the following guide to do that.

* [Authentication | Apollo Tools Guide](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-subscriptions/authentication.html)

You might want to do it on subscribing to events instead of establishing a
connection.
See the following pull request to `subscriptions-transport-ws`.

* [onSubscribe and use middleware to modify runtime SubscriptionOptions #78](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/pull/78)

Storybook
---------

This project uses [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook).
to develop and check presentational components.

Launch the Storybook server:

```sh
% yarn run storybook
```

[StoryShots](https://github.com/storybooks/storyshots) is also used to enable
snapshot tests.
When you modify a component and the render result is changed, Jest reports an
error. If the shown result is intended, press `u` to update the snapshot file.

Code Organization
-----------------

Redux actions, reducers and logic are managed by
[Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) rules in `src/ducks`
directory.

Tests are stored in `__tests__` directories under each component.

Git Hooks
---------

Git hooks are managed by [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
When you run `yarn` in this repo, Git hooks will be automatically created.

If you have a problem, you can create them manually.

```sh
% node node_modules/husky/bin/install.js
```

Our Git hooks are defined in `package.json`.
